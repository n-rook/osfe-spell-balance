# Spell Balance

This is a mod to adjust the spells available in One Step From Eden. I've noticed a lot of spells that seem to be way too weak, as well as a few that are outrageously strong. The goal of this mod is to make sure all spells are at least usable, and to tone down a few of the more ridiculous ones.

# How to build

Right now the build process is very simple and manual. Create a new directory called "Spell Balance". Copy Spells.xml into this directory, as well as workshopIcon.png and WorkshopItemInfo.png. Then copy that into "Mods" in the OSFE directory to test it out.

# General Principles

Spells with higher rarity can be more powerful (though they don't have to be). It's okay, for example, that Fimbulveter is more useful than Blizzard.

It costs time as well as mana to cast a spell. As such, Thunder is fine, but it would be inappropriate for "Quad Thunder" to deal 400 damage for 4 mana. Something like Ragnarok is better; it deals 350 damage and is higher rarity. However, you should get something for the extra mana: something like Thunderstorm, which does 75 damage per tile on average, is too weak in comparison to spells like Cold Snap or Anubis.

This should be obvious from the name, but I'm not going to adjust the power of weapons or artifacts. Trust me, this is enough work as it is. I'm also not going to change the basic function of spells.

## Reasonable spells

I'm honestly writing this for my own reference, so I have other spells to compare to.

For single-square damage, a spell like Thunder or Revenge is the baseline: 100 damage for 1 mana.

For AOE, 50 damage to all enemies for 1 mana is the baseline. Anubis is 70, but poison takes a long time to kick in.

Piercing attacks down a single line are very useful. Bow Snipe costs 4 mana and does 250 damage; plus, it has a reasonably long startup time. But it still feels powerful and good to have around.
