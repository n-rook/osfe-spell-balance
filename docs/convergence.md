## Rarity 0

### Tri Shot

**60 -> 70 damage**

Tri Shot is an odd spell. It costs 3 mana, and does varying amounts of damage based on the situation:
* 60 damage to a faraway enemy
* 180 damage when used up close
* 180 damage when used from far away with Trinity cast
* 540 damage when used from up close with Trinity cast

Plus, since it's triple-casted on Trinity cast, it doesn't actually use up your Trinity. So it's a nice enabler.

However, it's rare to be able to actually get the 540 damage off; the second and third casts are delayed, so your target has to sit in front of you for a long time.

I'd like to buff it to 90 damage, for numerological reasons, but that feels like too much: 900 damage is a lot for a 0 rarity spell, even if the conditions have to be perfect.

### Incline

**40 -> 50 damage**

Incline hits at most 7 times for 3 mana. However, the attacks are very slow, so it's not possible to hit a target with all the attacks unless they're actually stationary. 3 mana is a lot, so you should get more of a benefit from casting the spell.

This may need additional help.

### Sequencer

I need to get a better understanding of how Sequencer works or feels before I try adjusting it. I suspect it's fine as-is. It's hard to use effectively but getting a lot of bonus trinity is a nice advantage.

## Rarity 2

### Empower Ring

5 SP is a lot, but an ephemeral effect is tricky to use effectively.

### Limit Break

**10 -> 15 damage**
**40 -> 25 shots**
**0.1 -> 0.15 time between shots**

Limit break scales in a lot of different ways.

* At base, it hits 10x40 times, for 400 damage.
* If you have fragile, it hits in a cross, making connecting much easier.
* If you have spell power, it does 40 more damage per point of SP.
* The lower your max mana, the lower its cost. So to a certain extent, Limit Break is better the lower your max mana. It's rough if Limit Break decreases your max mana so you can't cast your spells.
* In rare cases, you can simplify your deck so much that you can play Limit Break over and over again for 0 mana.

These changes make Limit Break scale less strongly with Spell Power. The increase in time between shots just makes it so Limit Break takes about as long to fire as it always did. (Its total damage also decreases from 400 to 375, but that's not really important in comparison.)

These changes decrease Limit Break's total damage from 400 to 375; but more importantly they make it scale less strongly with Spell Power.

### Ping

**30 -> 50 damage**

Ping is a lot of work for not much payoff. In theory you can use it to rack up damage quickly if you stand next to an enemy, but in practice it's tricky to get in that position for long enough for it to be worthwhile.

## Rarity 3

### Power Saws

**No change**

Power Saws can do a _lot_ of damage if you have the Spell Power for it. With 8 SP, it's 400 damage in a reasonably large AOE. But it is rarity 3, and it's tricky to connect with twice.

I suspect Power Saws could use a nerf, but I'll leave it as-is for now.

### Sera Cannon

**No change**

I think Sera Cannon is fine. 800 damage for 2 mana is really good, but you give up a lot for it; that's a lot of artifacts you could buy instead.
