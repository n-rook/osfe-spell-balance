# Doublelift

Ah, the inexplicably named Doublelift. Known for jam cards and cards with hugely variable utility depending on exactly what your deck looks like. A lot of these cards are tricky to balance. 

## Rarity 1

### Ambient Burst

**Damage: 5 -> 10**

**Time between shots: 0.03 -> 0.02**

Ambient Burst scales slowly and locks you in place for awhile if you actually have good scaling with it. Even 20 spells is just 100 damage for 3 mana, which is not good (although it does scale well with Spell Power). Lowering the time between shots makes you less vulnerable if you manage to charge up a big one.

This might be too strong at this point, so it needs more testing.

### Jam Cannon

**No changes**

Jam Cannon is much worse than Jam Slam. It locks you in place and it's inconsistent. But it costs 0 mana; it doesn't really have to be very good to be worth playing. It's playable even with only 1-2 other sources of jam in your deck.

## Rarity 2

### Fling

**No changes**

Fling is of marginal value; it's hard to use effectively, and it requires an extra step of thought to consider "should I really consume this spell?" every time you cast it. But it does let you save a lot of mana and get rid of cards that aren't good in a fight. No change for now, but I'm considering kicking it down to 0 mana.

### Switchbait

**Mana cost: 2 -> 4**

Switchbait is an enabling card that deals a ton of damage for cheap, but imposes deckbuilding requirements in return, and makes you hold up spells to cast as well. This is fine. The problem is that it's way too good right now.

If you have a 250-damage card like Mine or Bow Snipe in the other slot, Switchbait does 500 damage. Ragnarok does 350 damage, and takes 4 mana. It's too much. Raising the mana cost to 4 puts it in line with other expensive single-target attacks.

Switchbait gets even better if you have unusually strong spells like Explosion! or Ragnarok, but that's okay; if you have the right deck Switchbait should do lots of damage. I don't actually care about Solo Saffron Switchbait / Ragnarok decks; Solo is very strong anyway and I'd rather keep Switchbait usable for the rest of the cast.

I'm not sure how strong Switchbait is with its cost doubled, so I'll have to keep an eye on it, but I think it's still playable in some decks.

### Viruspell

**No change**

I'm not really sure how powerful Viruspell truly is. It's possible to build a deck around it, but the effect is very anemic, so you do need to play it a bunch and throw it out a dozen times in 2 seconds for it to be good. As such, I don't think it's a problem.

## Rarity 3

### Gambit

**Mana cost: 4 -> 3**
**Damage: 30 -> 50**

Gambit is an odd duck. For 4 mana, it does 30 damage to a random tile for each spell in your deck, and instantly shuffles. 30 damage to a random tile is basically zero, even if you're shuffling 15 or so spells back in, so you're paying 4 mana for an instant shuffle.

Shuffling is bad because you can't do anything except regain mana and shoot your gun. So paying mana to shuffle faster isn't terrible. But 4 mana is a lot. If you have 1.6 regen, it takes 2.5 seconds to get 4 mana (this is the same time as it takes to shuffle, usually). And of course, while you can't do much while shuffling, you can regain mana to spend once you're done, which does have value.

I've lowered the cost to 3 mana to make it more viable. I've also increased the damage, but I don't think that matters very much; even 50 damage to random tiles is not a lot. Gambit may need further improvements.

### Preload

**Damage: 20 -> 80**

Like with Gambit, most of the value in Preload comes from the reduced shuffle time. But paying 2 mana to save 1 second of shuffle time is an even worse deal than paying 4 mana to save 2.5 seconds.

As such, I increased the damage a lot. This gives the spell a unique value proposition; you're paying about 1 extra mana to reduce your shuffle time by 1 second, which seems reasonable to me.

Another alternative would be to make the shuffle time decrease more significant, but at 2 seconds it would interfere with Speed Loader.

### Time Stop

**No changes**

Time Stop is often not any better than Time Slow, so it might need to be improved a bit, but I'm not entirely sure at this point.

## Rarity 4

### Midnight

**No changes**

To be honest, I've never cast Midnight, and it's such a strange effect that it's hard to evaluate. Stay tuned.
