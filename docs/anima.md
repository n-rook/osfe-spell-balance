# Anima

There are a lot of powerful and useful Anima spells, but there are also a lot of them that are very bad.

## Rarity 0

### Cold Medicine

**No change**

Cold Medicine costs 0, heals for 40 HP, and applies 2 frost stacks. This is 100 frost damage if the opponent is at full health, 60 otherwise, but with a big downside. It feels a little weak but I'd rather not change it just yet.

### Firewall

**40 -> 20 damage**

Firewall is extremely strong. 2 mana, and you get 40 damage and 4 flame tiles. At base, this is 180 damage with a downside (some enemies won't stand in the fire), but fire scales great, so it's often much better than that.

### Frost Barrage

**No change**

1x40 with frost for 2 mana is not good but 2x40 with frost is. Leaving as-is.

### Frostbolt

**40 -> 50 damage**

Frostbolt is anemic. In theory it's 90 damage and easy to aim, but in practice Frost isn't actually worth 50 damage, especially at the beginning of the game when you're likely to take it. I don't want to change it much because a number of other effects cast Frostbolt, but a small change like this should be fine.

### Back Burner

**No change**

I rarely take this spell so I'm not sure if it's too weak or not. Leaving flames on your side is a big downside.

## Rarity 1

### Ice Spikes

**60 -> 120 damage**

Ice Spikes is 60 damage plus 1 frost. The aiming gimmick is cool and fun, but it's a double-edged sword: If you dodge an attack fired down a row, your ice spikes will whiff.

I'd rather not make this deal 2 frost because that feels more like Frost Barrage or Blizzard. Instead, I'll increase the damage by a lot.

### Thunderstorm

**50 -> 100 damage**

Thunderstorm deals 50 damage per hit, 4x6 times, at rarity 1. There are 16 tiles, so this deals an average of 75 damage per tile. At rarity 1, you shouldn't get much for a huge AOE, but 75 is just too low; the card looks horrible next to Cold Snap or Anubis.

I'll start by doubling the damage to 100. This is good thematically because Thunder does 100 damage too. More buffs might be necessary.

### Twinferno

**50 -> 60 damage**

If you aim it properly, Twinferno is 50 damage twice for 2 mana, with the possibility of doing more damage to other things nearby. This is a little low, but it's not that bad, given the large AOE.

## Rarity 2

### Carpet Bomb

**40 -> 200 damage**

40 damage in a wide path for 3 mana, with a downside. It leaves fire too but that's a wash, since it leaves a ton of fire in your own side of the field as well. Plus, it makes you fragile.

If this spell is saddled with multiple downsides it should at least be a powerful effect. Let's start with 200 damage for now.

### Hailstorm

**10 -> 100 damage**

Similarly to Thunderstorm, Hailstorm just doesn't do enough. 18 hits, each one doing 10 damage plus frost. Changing Hailstorm is tough because it needs to be distinct from Cold Snap, Blizzard and Fimbulveter, all of which are big AOE frost effects. I think the way to do that with Hailstorm is to increase the fixed damage it deals. 100 damage feels about right; counting the frost, this means it's 150 damage per hit, or around 170 damage overall.

### Ice Hockey

**No change**

I have no idea how to evaluate this spell.

### Wildfire

**No change**

This is a little expensive for what it is. In a crowded normal enemy fight it's basically Firestorm: hit 4 enemies, put fire on their tiles. In a boss fight it's a lot worse than that. I'll leave it as-is for now but I think could probably use a little love.

## Rarity 3

### Flamberge

**100 -> 150 damage in the cone**

It's a gimmick! 100 damage in a cone and fire everywhere for only 2 mana, but it's only good if you can hit something in the front row, or better yet, on your side of the field. Somebody who can pull this off regularly deserves more than 100 damage; let's increase it to 150 for now.

## Rarity 4

### EXPLOSION!

**No change**

I want to buff EXPLOSION! but I need to make sure reducing the start- and end-lag doesn't make animations go out of sync, so I haven't done it yet.
